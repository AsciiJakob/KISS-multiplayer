# Troubleshooting
## I can connect to my server using its IP address, but it's not showing up on the server list!
There are a few reasons as to why this may happen.
- You may not have `show_in_server_list` set to `true` in your config.
- Server is not up to date with the latest KissMP-server version.
- Servers with inappropriate words in their name will automatically be blocked.
- To avoid abuse, there is a limit of 10 servers per IP address.
- Servers may not exceed the character limit of 64 characters for its name and 256 characters for its description.

## My friends can't to connect to my server!
This is probably the result of incorrect port forwarding or firewall issues. Make sure to follow the port forwarding guide from [Server Hosting](hosting.html)
